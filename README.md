## Executive Summary

Food Connections will be a web application designed to connect people who want to connect with others over food.The users of this application will be students/staff/faculty on RIT campus. Furthermore, users can be categorized into four areas: Hosts, Organizations, Applicants and Users.

Our application will allow users to do a number of different things around one common interest, food. Hosts will be able to host a group meal or a group activity. This can include anything from organizing a restaurant group link-up, organizing a group meal, potluck, organizing meals for when campus is on break, sharing recipes, holding cook-offs and cooking videos, and renting out kitchen/dining spaces. Additionally the host will be able to set preferences for who can apply (ie. only females if the hosts apartment is only female). Furthermore the host can detail their own interests and what they would like to talk about over the course of the meal so that people with similar interests can apply to meals where they want to talk to the people there. Hosts will also be able to tag their with both the type of food (Thai, American, etc) and potential allergies or allergy friendliness (Peanut, Soy, etc). Organizations on campus will also be users on our web application. They will be able to host food drives, cook-offs and any volunteer based event involving food. Users will have full access to join any host/organization event they would like. They will be able to share recipes and do a lot of what the host can do but on a secondary level. Meanwhile, Applicants to a meal will then be able either volunteer cooking expertise or groceries when they apply for a meal.

## Requirements

The app will provide a platform for users to engage in various food-related activities, including hosting group meals, potlucks, and cooking workshops.

Additionally, the app will allow Hosts to set participant preferences, tag events with food types and allergy information, and enable Organizations to run food-related events, ensuring a vibrant and inclusive environment for all users.
